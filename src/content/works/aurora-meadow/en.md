On this frigid April morning I waited for the first line of light to brush the meadow. A faint aurora mingled with dawn along the horizon while the leftover mist draped the moss like gauze. I chose a slightly longer exposure to preserve the weightless air and allow the colours to unfold with gentle contrast.

The brook beside the field mirrored the gradient sky, tiny ice crystals shimmering into flickers inside the frame. As the shutter clicked I heard the distant echo of the seaâ€”this island never lets me forget the breathing rhythm of nature.
