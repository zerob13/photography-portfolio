The profile of the dune is sharpest at sunset. From the ridge I waited for the wind to pause so the newly carved ripples could settle. Sunlight slid along the crest like a blade and in a breath the heat turned tender.

In the vast silence only my breathing and the shutter remained. This desert shifts my sense of scale: the shadow of a single grain can feel as grand as a mountain range.
