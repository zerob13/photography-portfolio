Twilight in Tuscany never hurries. The sun drifts along the hills while olive leaves collide in a low rustle. I set the camera beside the stone wall and waited for the light to graze the edges of the vineyards, weaving shadows and lines into a quiet score.

The air carries a herbal sweetness and distant bells from the village. Every press of the shutter recalls my first visit here years ago, when I learned that light itself can become a language.
