Winters in the Alps carry a cutting wind. I searched along the ridge for an opening in the cloud sea, waiting for distant peaks to reveal their outline for a few seconds. The telephoto lens compressed the layers of mountains, stitching light like fine thread between the snow lines.

When the gust swept across the lens my fingers nearly went numb, yet I felt poised at the threshold between cloud and stone, hearing the mountain's slow, steady pulse.
