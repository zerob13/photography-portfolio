Even at 10 p.m. the pier is threaded with movement; the city never truly slows. I pinned the tripod against the boards and let a long exposure transform passing ferries into ribbons of light. Neon dyed the sky a deep blue and planes occasionally scratched brief silver notes across it.

Within the city's clamour the gentle slap of water played like a quiet melody. With each exposure I wasn't chasing a single instant but the collective breath of the metropolis.
