At dawn Banff's lake becomes a silent mirror, mist lifting slowly from the surface. I walked the shoreline searching for a balance between the distant peaks and the clouds. To keep the water velvety I chose a smaller aperture with a steady shutter speed.

Occasional geese cut through the still reflections before calm returned. Standing there I felt time elongate; even my breathing slowed to the rhythm of the ripples.
