Rain turns New York's streets into vast mirrors. Taxi tail lights and neon ads blend into liquid colour across the pavement while I weave through the crowd, chasing the densest beat of the city.

A 28mm field of view holds the commotion at the corner and keeps the viewer close. Raindrops drum on the camera but I can't stopâ€”the city's pulse lives in those scattered points of light.
