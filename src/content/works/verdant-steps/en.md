Just after the storm the terraces stacked like mirrors across the slope. Mist rose slowly from the valley as I followed the local guide up the slick stone steps. Every ridge reflected a different shade of green, like a staircase of notes.

I kept the shutter slow enough to hold the floating threads of fog while leaving the water's surface soft. Only birdsong and footsteps remained; the land was catching its delicate breath after the rain.
